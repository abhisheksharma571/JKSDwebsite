                    <span className='text-xl md:text-2xl font-medium'>What Is a Robot:</span> Science fiction frequently presents robots as humanoid machines with emotions and intelligence, but in actuality, robots are far more useful and diverse. These are advanced devices built to perform a wide range of functions, from basic autonomous operations to intricate repetitive activities. The Czech word “robota,” which denotes forced labour, is where the word “robot” originated. In 1920, Karel Čapek’s play “R.U.R.” (Rossum’s Universal Robots) helped make it popular. Since then, robots have developed from abstract ideas to indispensable instruments in many different fields.
