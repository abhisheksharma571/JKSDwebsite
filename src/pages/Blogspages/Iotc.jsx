These are advanced devices built to perform a wide range of functions, from basic autonomous operations to intricate repetitive activities. The Czech word “robota,” which denotes forced labour, is where the word “robot” originated. In 1920, Karel Čapek’s play “R.U.R.” (Rossum’s Universal Robots) helped make it popular. Since then, robots have developed from abstract ideas to indispensable instruments in many different fields.
